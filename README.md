The Java files here are - 

   1) My solutions to various Leetcode problems. 
   2) Samples of various data structures and algorithms, generic or otherwise.
   3) Possibly my Hackerrank solutions.
   4) Various other tests. Including git command tests.

The programs here are strictly Java programs.
